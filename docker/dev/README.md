# DSTY devcontainer

This image is created by vscode and used as a [devcontainer](../../.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) for local development.

It contains both the example jobs and test jobs. It will automaticly reload both the library code and the job code so that development and testing can happen locally without the need for commiting and pushing.

## Using

Once vscode opens inside the devcontainer, the jenkins gui will be avaliable on [127.0.0.1:5050](http://127.0.0.1:5050).
